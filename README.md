# Basic Calculator

I completed this program as part of my HyperionDev Software Development Fundamentals bootcamp. The task was to create a simple calculator program that met the following criteria: 

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations should be supported
- The program should take two numbers as inputs
- The program should output the result of the selected operation on the two input numbers
- Use defensive programming to catch any errors, specifically the Zero division error
- Write the inputed sum and answer to a text file and display the text file to the terminal
- Allow the user to input and read there own text file.

I have implemented the program in python, and you can find the source code in this repository.
